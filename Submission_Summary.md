### Project Overview (200 words)

Smart Recipe Generator is a web application that suggests recipes based on user-provided ingredients and ingredient photos. Users can enter ingredients manually or upload an image for automatic ingredient recognition. The app supports dietary preferences (vegetarian, gluten-free, vegan) and allows filtering recipes by difficulty, cooking time, and dietary restrictions. Each recipe includes detailed instructions, nutrition info, and serving size adjustment. Users can rate recipes, save favorites, and receive personalized suggestions based on their ratings. The recipe database contains 20+ diverse recipes across multiple cuisines. The matching algorithm uses weighted scoring and ingredient substitution logic to maximize relevant results. The UI is clean, intuitive, and fully mobile-responsive. The app is deployed on Vercel for free, instant access. Documentation and error handling are included for a smooth user experience.
